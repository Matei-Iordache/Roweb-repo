### The script for the devops challenge
Here is the [script](https://github.com/Matei-Iordache/Roweb-repo/blob/master/script.sh) that checks if a local repository is synchronized with it's remote repository.
Also the script will tell you if a subfolder is not a git repository.
#### Short tutorial on how to use the script
1. Place the script in the desired folder.
2. Give it file permission to run.
3. Run the script with the "./script.sh" command in the command line.
